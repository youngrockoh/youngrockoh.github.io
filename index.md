## About Me

I am currently working as a senior research engineer at Samsung SDS since March 2019. 
In 2019, I received Ph.D. (Dissertation: Mathematical Modeling and Analysis for Adaptive Medium Access Protocols in Wireless Networks) from the department of Mathematical Sciences (Applied Probability) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) under the supervision of Prof. Ganguk Hwang.
In 2013, I received B.S from the department of Mathematical Sciences at KAIST.

My primary research objective is to develop learning algorithms for training deep neural networks in a more accurate and efficient manner using techniques from statistics and probability theory. 
To this end, I have conducted research on deep metric learning and interpretable machine learning for convolutional neural networks and am now expanding domains to graph neural networks.
